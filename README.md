# Gatsby Wordpress Search (Beta)

Add search functionality (powered by [Lunr.js](https://github.com/olivernn/lunr.js/)) to your Gatsby site based on Wordpress data.

The plugin filters post title, post content and all ACF fields.

## Requirements

Gatsby plugin: gatsby-source-wordpress

## Instructions

1. Include the .php file into your WP functions.php to create a custom endpoint. Once this is done you should be able to see the json output at "/wp-json/wp/v1/searchResults".

## PS . I had to add "**/search", to included routes so that we could pick up allWordpressWpSearch in GraphQL Query


2. Add the SearchComponent.js to your Gatsby project

3. Import the component and style it. Right now I'm using emotion css but you can style it however you want.

```javascript
import React, { Component } from "react";
import { css } from "emotion";
import SearchComponent from "src/components/SearchComponent";

const container = css`
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
  padding: 40px;
  background: #f7f7f7;
  max-width: 600px;
`;

const input = css`
  width: 100%;
  height: 40px;
`;

const suggests = css`
  max-width: 600px;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
  margin-left: 0;
`;

const suggest = css`
  padding: 30px 10px;
  border-bottom: 1px solid #ddd;
  width: 100%;
`;

const suggestTitle = css`
  margin-bottom: 20px;
`;

const suggestContent = css``;

export default class Search extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <SearchComponent
        minCharacters={4}
        contentCharacters={300}
        componentStyles={{
          container: container,
          input: input,
          suggests: suggests,
          suggest: suggest,
          suggestTitle: suggestTitle,
          suggestContent: suggestContent
        }}
      />
    );
  }
}
```
